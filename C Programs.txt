1)Write a c program to print Fibonacci series of given range.
2)Write a c program to reverse any number.
3)Write a c program to check given number is prime number or not.
4)Write a c program to check given number is palindrome number or not.
5)C program to count number of digits in a number.
6)Program to find largest of n numbers in c.
7)Split number into digits in c programming.
8)Write a c program to swap two numbers without using third variable.
9)Write a c program to convert the string from upper case to lower case and lower case to upper case.
10)Write a c program to count the different types of characters in given string.
11)Write a c program to reverse a string but without using string.h header file.
12)Write a c program to find out sum of diagonal element of a matrix.
13)Write a c program to find out multiplication of two matrices and then find transport of a resultant matrix .

14)Write a c program to check whether a number is strong or not
Definition of strong number:
A number is called strong number if sum of the factorial of its digit is equal to number itself. For example: 145 since
1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

15)C program for finding Armstrong numbers
Definition according to c programming point of view:
THOSE NUMBERS WHICH SUM OF THE CUBE OF ITS DIGITS IS EQUAL TO THAT NUMBER ARE KNOWN AS ARMSTRONG NUMBERS. FOR EXAMPLE 153 SINCE 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1+ 125 + 9 =153
OTHER ARMSTRONG NUMBERS: 370,371,407 ETC.

16) C program to check perfect number
Definition of perfect number or What is perfect number? 
Perfect number is a positive number which sum of all positive divisors excluding that number is equal to that number. For example 6 is perfect number since divisor of 6 are 1, 2 and 3.  Sum of its divisor is
1 + 2+ 3 =6
